Even though I don’t work on this project as much as I’d like, it’s something I definitely plan to do. As a child, I was fascinated by this video game because of its mix of turn-based gameplay, deck building, and dexterity. The music was also pretty cool. Since most of the assets are available online, I started coding this beauty with Excalibur.js."
