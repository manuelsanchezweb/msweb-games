Although I've always been more interested in the 2D world, I hadn't focused much on the 3D world perspective. However, I decided to explore it and try to understand how things work there. I began by using plain vanilla TypeScript with Three.js to create a very cool [Art Gallery in 3D](https://github.com/manuelsanchezweb/art-gallery-threejs) (special thanks to my friend Emilian Kasemi for all his input). I soon decided to experiment with React. I followed a tutorial by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpOZup_3P_A) and attempted to question and improve some aspects of it. The game includes:

- First Person Camera
- Movement
- Keyboard Input
- Add/Remove Cubes functionality
- Save World in Local Storage
- Texture Selector
