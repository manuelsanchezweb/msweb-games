Extremely cool game with a lot of features. You can create worlds, go through them, interact with people, create your own pizzas (instead of pokemon) and fight agains other's pizzas. It is released as I finished the tutorial, did not work further there. However, it was extremely helpful for me to develop the <a href="/blog/retro-world-engine"> Retro World Engine</a>.
